# Attribution

Code modified from [densestvoid's groupme repository](https://github.com/densestvoid/groupme) (for freshness) and [karmanyaahm's fork](https://github.com/karmanyaahm/groupme) for the `IndexRelations` and `real-time` components.

Added `client.IndexAllRelations`, modified "client.IndexRelations" to accept `since` parameter and moved relations api code into `relations_api.go`
